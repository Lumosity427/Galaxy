# Galaxy: A Comprehensive Proxy Hub

Welcome to the Galaxy repository! Below, you will find a form for inquiries regarding collaboration or permissions.

## Overview

Galaxy was crafted using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), in contrast to Universal, which was developed with traditional coding techniques. Galaxy serves as a comprehensive hub for proxies, games, and a multitude of resources, all accessible from a single website. We continually update our offerings to ensure a rich and engaging experience for our users.

Previously known as "BlueSquare," Galaxy underwent a rebranding to "MEGA SITE." This transition embodies the unification of various existing gaming hubs, such as Turkey and BlueSquare, along with numerous other platforms. This endeavor was made possible through the collaboration and support of contributors from these diverse websites. A special thanks goes to G, our most prominent member, for his exceptional work on [Turkey](https://turkeyisbackiguesswalmart.my.canva.site/), among others. 

Due to time constraints, I may not be able to acknowledge everyone individually, but your contributions are deeply appreciated.
