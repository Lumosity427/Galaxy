 # Galaxy: A Fully-Fledged Proxy Hub

Welcome to the Galaxy repository! Here you will  find a form for people who want to contribute or get permission to contribute in some way.

## Overview

 Galaxy was created with the help of  [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), while Universal was created with the help of programming languages. It is a central place to find  proxies, games and many other resources on one website. We add new features on a regular basis to make  the experience as enjoyable as possible for the users of our website.

Galaxy was called  'BlueSquare' before it was renamed to 'MEGA SITE'. This change represents the combination of all the present  gaming hubs like Turkey and BlueSquare and many other platforms. This has only been made possible by the  help and collaboration of the contributors from these various websites. A very big thanks goes to G, our  biggest member for his great work on  [Turkey](https://turkeyisbackiguesswalmart.my.canva.site/) and many other sites.  I may not be able to reply to  everyoneâ€™s comments personally due to time constraints, but I appreciate every effort that has been made.
